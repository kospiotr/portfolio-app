It guides bankers through internal processes in an engaging, digitised format, to manage deals more effectively, and is scalable to other products. DealMaker was born out of the recognition that client-facing staff are spending too much time co-ordinating internal activities, and it is intended to free them to better develop client relationships.​\nProvides bankers a step by step      guide on what the internal processes are for a particular product area and      provides learning and instructions on how to do themAllows Deal Teams to      collaborate more effectively by setting out clear roles and      responsibilities for each and every taskIncludes a reference library,      where there are links to policies and procedures, tools and templates      readily available and consolidated in one place\n\nDataVisa\n\nPowered by DealMaker, DataVisa is a new global platform being developed by Corporate and Institutional Digital for colleagues, which simplifies HSBC’s data sharing and data privacy processes.\n\n\nThe new technology will transform decision-making and approvals routing, by automating the process via an in-built rules engine, supported by Solidatus, a RegTech software company.\n\n\nIt will provide real-time, centralised case status tracking, creating a clean audit trail.\n\n\nThe new platform will initially apply automated workflow management for two separate approvals, Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and Data Sharing, replacing the existing manual process.\n\n\nWhen launched, DataVisa’s rules engine will automate the approvals process for the use of personal data, and regulatory approvals of cross-border data sharing requests.\n\n\nKey features:\n\nOne standard global toolEnhanced capture of data and processesEasy tracking of DataVisa requests such as the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), and Data SharingSimplified sign-off process, shorter average approval timeStep-by-step guide to securing approvals\n\n\nWhat problem are we solving?\n\nThe platform is being developed as the current approvals processes relating to both data privacy and data sharing are standalone, which leads to duplication of effort and resources.\n\n\nCurrently, digital project managers need to submit a manual-based submission which is lengthy and provides limited visibility on approval requirements and their status.\n\n\nThe new platform will allow a project manager to quickly raise and submit a data privacy or data sharing application, in a new digital format.\n\n\nThe platform will then either grant an automated approval, or will direct the application for further assessment to the relevant decision maker in the specific function, country or region.\n\n\nIn one consolidated place, DataVisa provides the ability to manage the sign-off process for transferring or sharing HSBC data across HSBC legal entities, and to third parties. \n\n\nThe dedicated site speeds up approvals and allows for faster decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Description": "​The STP HUB - Spectre project started in Autumn 2016 when a GFT team of 18 people was established in Poland. \n \nThis is was one of the projects that, apart from the typical set of back-end, front-end and testing specialists, also involved two local business analysts fully dedicated to requirements clarification. From day one, the team cooperated with several distributed client teams. Our daily calls gathered people from London (UK), Pune (India) and Guanghzou (China). From time to time, we also had guests from other locations while on-boarding markets from the US. We quickly learned how to treat time zone differences as an ally rather than an enemy. As a result, during the last two years, we have proven that cooperation across several countries can be truly effective, as long as you have clearly defined goals and operate according to agile methodology.\n \nThe Spectre project, that used to be called STP HUB, was intended to deliver a new centralized platform for Straight Through Processing of trades from many different regions and markets. The system was implemented from scratch to replace an older solution that was difficult to maintain and extend in capabilities. \n \nDay by day, we learned how to deal with new types of trades and how to make our processing more efficient. Agile methodology was used to setup the whole delivery process. Small incrementals helped the client in monitoring if product delivery went in the correct direction and if it satisfied business needs. \n \nThere were some challenging decisions to be taken about technologies that could help in fulfilling non-functional requirements. At face value, they seemed straightforward: the new platform should be efficient, stable, easy to maintain and to scale. Golden sources of reference data should be used as often as possible. However, the most important point was: manual interventions to fix static data should be reduced to a total minimum. Owing to that, ratio factor of successfully and efficiently processed trades would be maintained at a satisfactory level. And although the project did not come to an end, we already satisfied most of those points!\n \nThe GFT team actively participated in discussions about technologies and architecture of the system. We designed most of it. We opted for micro-service architecture combined with Apache Storm for trades processing and a modern UI blotter implemented in ReactJS, integrated with back-end using web-sockets for live trade updates visible on screen. Today we can confirm that it was a really good choice. Processing is really efficient and our dashboards have been appreciated by business users who can see everything related to trade processing in just two screens that are constantly updated. All of this is supported by automated building process created using Ansible scripts and Jenkins builds that enables us to restart all of our services on a chosen server with just a single click.\n \n \nThe Challenge\n§Globaltierone bank\n§Complex monolithic architecture supporting up to 1M trades per day across markets\n§High rate of trade processing failures due to missing reference data creating reputational risk\n§High rate of manual intervention to fix and re-process trades incurring operational cost and risk\n§Requirement to develop a new Fixed IncomeSTParchitecture\n\nThe Engagement\n§Redesigned architecture to meet client requirements of stability, reliability and speed\n§Created new clusters on UNIX servers automatically provisioned usingAnsible/Jenkins\n§Createdmicroservices supporting shared functional responsibilities across markets\n§UsedMuleSoft for API management but later migrated to more cost effectiveopen-source solution\n§Used Apache Storm to create fast, scalable,realtime processing of complex routing and workflows\n§Used open-source tooling such asGrafana,Kibana and ELK for monitoring/alerting\n§Built custom tools to supportmicroservice management – verification of service health andversion\n§Designed and built an ION integrated testing framework to publish test trades\n§Integrated with golden source data stores to provide intraday updates of reference data\n§Created a modern HTML5 UI usingwebsockets forrapidconnectionbetween UIand Back-end\n§Built UI usingReact providing new search functions, performance dashboards and real time blotter\n§Built UI to support for posttrade processing and four-eye workflow for additional control\n§Used TDD & BDD and tools such Cucumber & Selenium in a mature DevOps CD pipeline\n\nThe Benefit\n§Vastly simplified architecture improving stability, reliability and speed\n§Modern UI providing vastly improved usability, visibility and control\n§Full test, build & release automation supporting fast, controlled change\n§Ability to deploy multiple releases to production per day\n§MiFID II compliant",
